# Kickstarting with Excel (An Analysis of Crowdsourcing Campaigns)

## Overview of Project
Louise previously had our company, XYX, complete analysis prior to kicking off a fundraising campaign for "Fever", a play she wanted to produce. Louise used this prior analyis to structure her fundraising campaign. Her campaign fell short of it's goal. Now that the campaign has come to a close, she wants to see how her crowdsourcing compared to other campaign's goals and launch dates.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to compare and contrast Louise fundraising for "Fever" to other campaigns and launch dates. In doing this, Louise would be able to start a list of 'best practices' and 'lessons learned' that she can continue to grow with her career. Hopefully this analysis will Louise what changes she can make to make her next fundraising campaign(s) more successful.

## Analysis and Challenges
Louise wants company XYX, to look specifically at the differences in funding goals and launch dates. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the largest difficulties I faced in doing this analysis is that I had created a custom theme and saved of each of my graphs as png files so that the colors on the lines on my graphs matched the lines on the graphs in the challenge perfectly. When I went in to reveiw them I noticed that the first graph's color had been updated to the theme in the second graph. I updated them again and this is when I noticed that that in the version of Microsoft Excel that I have (Microsoft 360) you can only have one color theme per workbook.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
