* The parent category when filtered down to look just at the US. Successful categories become similar between music and theater.

## Subcategory Outcomes

* When we look at the Subcategory Outcomes graph we can see that the vast majority of kickstarters are plays and that the majority are successful.\
## Outcomes by Launch Date

)

* Looking at this graph it appears that May and June have high kick starter success rates and low cancelled rates.


Recomendation: Have the kickstarter in May or June as they appear to have higher success rates based on the data.
